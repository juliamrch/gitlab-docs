# Count the number of words in the document and, assuming the average
# reading speed by words-per-minute, calculate the time taken in
# minutes to read the given number of words. If there are any seconds

    # This is a rough estimate and given that the algorithm to find the words
    # is very simple, it's best to overcalculate and increase the WPM.
    # Otherwise, we end up with big reading time numbers.
