## Tasks for all releases

Documentation [for handling the docs release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md) is available.

Prerequisites:

- Make sure you have all the [needed tools](/doc/setup.md) installed on your system.

Terminology:

The following terms are used throughout this document:

- **Stable branch**: This is the branch that matches the GitLab version being released. For example,
  for GitLab 16.0, the stable branch is `16.0`.

### Between the 17th and 20th of each month

1. [ ] Cross-link to the main MR for the release post: `<add link here>`
   ([Need help finding the MR?](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=release%20post&label_name%5B%5D=blog%20post))
1. [ ] On the day of the [code cut-off](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-process) (17th, but is sometimes moved earlier), share the following message in the `#tw-team` channel:

   >:mega: I will run the docs release soon. Because we're close to the code cutoff, **don't add new links** to the docs navigation before I cut the stable branch.
   >
   >Moving, renaming, or deleting entries is allowed. If you're unsure, please assign me to the nav MR.

1. [ ] Monitor the `#releases` Slack channel. When the announcement
   `This is the candidate commit to be released on the 22nd` is made, it's time to begin.
1. [ ] [Create a stable branch and Docker image for the release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md#create-stable-branch-and-docker-image-for-release):

   1. [ ] In the root path of the `gitlab-docs` repository, update your local clone:

      ```shell
      make update
      ```

   1. [ ] Create the stable branch:

      ```shell
      make create-stable-branch
      ```

      - A branch `X.Y` for the release is created.
      - A new `X.Y.Dockerfile` is created and automatically committed.
      - The new branch is pushed.

      After the branch is created, the
      [`image:docs-single` job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/7fbb5e1313ebde811877044e87f444a0a283fed4/.gitlab/ci/docker-images.gitlab-ci.yml#L107-129)
      runs and creates a new Docker image tagged with the name of the stable branch
      (for example, see [the 15.6 release pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/pipelines/702437095)).

   1. [ ] Share the following message in the `#tw-team` channel:

      > :mega: The stable branch for `gitlab-docs` was created. You can now make changes to docs navigation as usual.

   1. [ ] When the job finishes, confirm the Docker image has been created. Go to the `registry` environment at
      <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/environments/folders/registry> and confirm the image
      is listed.

   **NOTE:**
   The `image:docs-single` job may fail if stable branches have not been
   created for all the related projects. Some of the stable branches are
   created close to the 22nd, so you might need to run a new pipeline for the
   stable branch before the release.

   Optionally, you can check the job log to see which project does not have a stable branch
   created for the release yet. Then check that project's branches for a branch with `-stable`.
   For example, for `gitlab-runner`: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/branches?state=all&sort=updated_desc&search=-stable>

After the tasks above are complete, you don't need to do anything for a few days.

### On the 22nd, or the first business day after

After the release post is live on the 22nd, or the next Monday morning if the release post happens on a weekend:

1. [ ] Verify that the [pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/pipelines?page=1&scope=all) for the stable branch (filter by branch)
   has passed and created a [Docker image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/container_registry/631635?orderBy=NAME&sort=desc&search[]=)
   tagged with the release version. ([If it fails, how do I fix it?](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md#imagedocs-single-job-fails-when-creating-the-docs-stable-branch))
   - To filter the list of pipelines to the stable branch, select the **Branch name** filter then manually input the stable branch's name. For example, "Branch name = 16.0".
1. [ ] [Create a docs.gitlab.com release merge request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md#create-release-merge-request)
   which updates the version dropdown menu for all online versions, updates the archives list, and adds
   the release to the Docker configuration.
1. Deploy the versions:
   1. [ ] Merge the docs release merge request.
   1. [ ] Go to the [scheduled pipelines page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/pipeline_schedules)
      and run the `Build Docker images manually` pipeline.
   1. [ ] In the scheduled pipeline you just started, wait for the `test:image:docs-latest` job to finish, then manually run the `image:docs-latest`
      job that builds the `:latest` Docker image.
   1. [ ] When the `image:docs-latest` job is complete, run the `Build docs.gitlab.com every hour` scheduled pipeline.
1. [ ] After the deployment completes, open `docs.gitlab.com` in a browser. Confirm
   both the latest version and the correct pre-release version are listed in the documentation version dropdown.
1. [ ] Check all published versions of the docs to ensure they are visible and that their version menus have the latest versions.
1. [ ] In this issue, create separate _threads_ for the retrospective, and add items as they appear:

   ```markdown
   ## :+1: What went well this release?
   ## :-1: What didnâ€™t go well this release?
   ## :chart_with_upwards_trend: What can we improve going forward?
   ```

1. [ ] Mention `@gl-docsteam` in a comment and invite them to read and participate in the retro threads.

   ```markdown
   @gl-docsteam here's the docs release issue for XX.ZZ with some retro threads, per our [process](#on-the-22nd-or-the-first-business-day-after).
   ```

After the 22nd of each month:

1. [ ] Create a release issue for the
   [next TW](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/#regularly-scheduled-tasks)
   and assign it to them.
1. [ ] **Major releases only.** Update
   [OutdatedVersions.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/OutdatedVersions.yml)
   with the newly-outdated version.
1. [ ] Improve this checklist. Continue moving steps from
   [`releases.md`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md)
   to here until the issue template is the single source of truth and the documentation provides extra information.
